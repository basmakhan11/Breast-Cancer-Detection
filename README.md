# Breast-Cancer-Detection
The project aims to develop an effective breast cancer diagnosis system using machine learning. By evaluating various classifiers on patient data, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved the highest accuracy of 97.07% in predicting breast cancer, while the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier had a slightly lower accuracy of 96%. This system is particularly valuable in low-income countries where medical resources and specialists are limited. Machine learning can significantly enhance healthcare by providing early and accurate breast cancer predictions, thus improving diagnosis and treatment efficiency.

In this study, we used the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which originates from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals in Madison. The dataset includes records from 699 breast cancer patients, with 458 samples (65.5%) classified as Benign and 241 samples (34.5%) as Malignant. It consists of 10 features (attributes) and 2 target classes (Benign and Malignant).
